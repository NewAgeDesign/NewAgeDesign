### **Core Values**

### **KAIZEN: Continuous Improvement**

Kaizen emphasizes daily small improvements, aiming for a 1% enhancement each day rather than seeking immediate perfection. We break down complex problems into manageable, achievable goals to facilitate steady progress.

### **IKIGAI: Purposeful Living**

Ikigai represents having a purpose, focusing on four pillars: “what you love”, “what you’re good at”, “what the world needs”, and “what the world will pay for”. We believe our clients' primary purpose lies at the intersection of these pillars, and we strive to guide them toward this fulfilling balance.

### **WABI-SABI: Embracing Imperfection**

Wabi-Sabi finds beauty in imperfection. We focus on the smallest details, leveraging flaws or weaknesses to our clients’ advantage while enhancing their strengths.

### **SHOSHAN: Beginner's Mindset**

Shoshan involves approaching challenges with a beginner’s mindset. While we are experts in our field, we remain humble and recognize our knowledge gaps. This humility drives us to thoroughly research and tailor solutions to meet our clients' unique needs.

### **GAMBARU: Perseverance**

Gambaru signifies working hard with tenacity, especially during tough times. We value patience and always strive to do our best, believing that the journey and shared experiences are more rewarding than the final destination.

### **SHINRIN-YOKU: Nature's Inspiration**

Shinrin-Yoku, or forest bathing, means immersing ourselves in nature. We find beauty and timeless wisdom in nature, drawing inspiration from it to enrich our work.
